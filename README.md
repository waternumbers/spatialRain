# spatialRain

This package contains various functions for merging spatial pixel based
rainfall data, for example from satellites and NWP models and rain gauge time
series. 

The package is inspired by the
rainmerging package available on
[github](https://github.com/zedzulkafli/Rainmerging) or
[zendo](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18869) which was never released to
CRAN. A relatively complete list of the methods implimented in the package can be found in:

TRMM-rain gauge data  merging techniques at the daily time scale for
distributed rainfall-runoff modeling applications, Journal of
Hydrometeorology.
